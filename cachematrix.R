## Computes the inverse of a matrix and caches the results

## Creates an object that caches the inverse of a matrix

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Computes the inverse of a matrix after first checking for a cached solution

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
